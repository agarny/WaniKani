This is a simple program that takes advantage of the [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/) [API](https://www.wanikani.com/api) to retrieve various user information. It works on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">macOS</a>.

No binaries are currently provided, so you need to compile the program yourself using [Qt](https://www.qt.io/).

Some of the ideas crome from elsewhere (e.g. https://www.wanikani.com/chat/api-and-third-party-apps/1608 for the wallpaper).

**Note:** the icon used for the application comes from http://blog.wanikani.com/ (which, hopefully, is fine to use...) while other icons come from the [Oxygen](http://packages.ubuntu.com/zesty/oxygen-icon-theme) library, which is released under [LGPL v3.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0).
