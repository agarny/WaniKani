This is a simple program that automatically generates and sets a wallpaper on either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">macOS</a>. The wallpaper is based either on the Kanjis one has studied using [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/) or on all the Kanjis available for study on that platform.

No binaries are currently provided, so you will need to compile the program yourself using [Qt](https://www.qt.io/).

The original idea (and parts of this implementation) comes from https://www.wanikani.com/chat/api-and-third-party-apps/1565 and https://www.wanikani.com/chat/api-and-third-party-apps/1608.

**Note:** the icon used in the application comes from http://blog.wanikani.com/ (hopefully, it's fine...).
