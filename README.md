This is a simple program that automatically generates and sets a wallpaper based on the Kanjis one has studied using [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/).

No binaries are provided, so you need to compile it yourself using [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) (sorry!).

The original idea (and parts of this implementation) comes from https://www.wanikani.com/chat/api-and-third-party-apps/1565 and https://www.wanikani.com/chat/api-and-third-party-apps/1608 (from which the background was extracted -- I hope it's fine!).

Finally, the icon used in the application comes from http://blog.wanikani.com/ (once again, I hope it's fine!).
